# Module 12 Challenge - Bellybutton-Biodiversity Study

## Overview of the Project

# Purpose

The purpose of this project is to build an interactive dashboard to display data from a provided JSON data file. This website is able to filter the dataset according to user input on the Test Subject ID drop-down menu and update the graphs with the individual results. Our client, Roza, would like to provide her volunteers with a dashboard where they can view their personalized test results. 

## Results

### Deliverable 1 - Create a Horizontal Bar Chart
The bar chart below provides a breakdown of the top 10 most common bacteria cultures found in the selected individual.

### Deliverable 2 - Create a Bubble Chart
The bubble chart below provides a description of the total microbiome of the selected individual's belly button. This chart allows us to see all of the different bacteria cultures present, while the size of the bubbles denote the amount (sample values) of bacteria found.

### Deliverable 3 - Create a Gauge Chart
The gauge chart below serves as a quick reference of the weekly frequency the selected individual washes their belly button.

### Deliverable 4 - Customize the Dashboard
We have included a variety of Bootstrap customizations to our webpage:
1. Included an image on the jumbotron.
2. Added background color to the webpage.
3. Change the font style for the head and body elements.
4. Included a custom styled navbar that links to the "bar" and "bubble" graphs on the home page.
5.

## Summary

### Recommendations
Our program could be improvded by adding additional elements that explore how the selected individual compares to the dataset as a whole. This would allow individuals the opportunity to see how their contributions fit in. This could be accomplished by providing a histogram of the distribution of belly button washing frequency and a chart depicting the total amount of available bacteria cultures by OTU ID.
